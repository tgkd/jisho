# Privacy Policy — Jisho AI
**Effective date:** Oct 1, 2025  
**Contact:** jisho_ai@proton.me

## Who we are
Jisho AI (“we”, “our”, “us”) is the data controller for this app. For any privacy questions, contact **jisho_ai@proton.me**.

## What we (don’t) collect
We do **not** collect, track, or share personal data from your use of the app. The app works offline and does not include advertising SDKs, analytics, crash reporting, or device identifiers (including IDFA). No App Tracking Transparency prompt is shown.

## On-device data
Settings, history, favorites, and similar app data are stored **locally on your device**. This data is removed when you uninstall the app.

## Network requests
The app may make network requests only to open external sources you choose or to check for dictionary updates. We do **not** log these requests or link them to any individual.

## Third-party content
The app includes dictionary data from the **JMdict** and **KANJIDIC** projects by EDRDG under an open license, credited in-app (About → Data Sources). We do **not** send user data to these projects.

## Support communications
If you email us at **jisho_ai@proton.me**, we will receive your email address and message contents so we can respond. We keep such messages only as long as needed to handle your request and for our legitimate interests in maintaining support records.

## Purchases (if offered in the future)
If subscriptions or purchases are offered, they will be processed by Apple. We do not receive your personal data from Apple for billing.

## Your rights
Where applicable law grants you rights (e.g., access, correction, deletion, objection), you can exercise them by emailing **jisho_ai@proton.me**. Because the app does not collect personal data from usage, these rights typically apply only to information you voluntarily send us (e.g., support emails).

## Children’s privacy
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided personal data via email, contact us and we will delete it.

## Changes to this policy
We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available at this URL, with an updated effective date.

## How to contact us
For any privacy questions or requests, email **jisho_ai@proton.me**.
